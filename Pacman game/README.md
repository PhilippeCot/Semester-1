# Projet Pac-Man in Python

### Requirements
`python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`

## Introduction
This Pac-Man project was developed as part of a school assignment at Polytechnique Montreal. The aim was to create a simplified version of the iconic game using Python and Pygame. The project involved implementing key game features like character behavior, level progression, and game screens. I am proud to share that I received a perfect score of 100% for this work, reflecting the effort and dedication put into its development.

Please note that you need to run the main.py file to launch the game.



#### File Details:
